mark-meets-gauss
================

the functions included in this package provides methods for both fitting
vanilla gaussian mixture models (via the expectation maximization algorithm, 
see dempster 1977) and mixture models with transition probabilities between
derived clusters. the gmmarkov function also provides a self-supervised
clustering algorithm which determines the number of clusters via the akaike
information criterion.

usage
-----

each of the functions have detailed internal descriptions of their operation.
